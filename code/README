Snowplow is an enterprise-strength marketing and product analytics platform. It does three things:

1. Identifies your users, and tracks the way they engage with your website or application
2. Stores your users' behavioural data in a scalable "event data warehouse" you control: in Amazon S3 and (optionally) Amazon Redshift or Postgres
3. Lets you leverage the biggest range of tools to analyse that data incl. big data toolset (e.g. Hive, Pig, Mahout) via EMR or more traditional tools e.g. Tableau, R, Chartio to analyse that behavioural data
